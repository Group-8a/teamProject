        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MIL) provides a synergistic environment dedicated to the study and development of intelligent, autonomous robots. The faculty and students associated with the laboratory conduct research in the theory and realization of machine intelligence covering topics such as machine learning, real-time computer vision, statistical modeling, robot kinematics, autonomous vehicles, teleoperation and human interfaces, robot and nonlinear control, computational intelligence, neural networks, and general robotics. Applications of MIL research include autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), autonomous water surface vehicles (ASVs), autonomous land vehicles, autonomous air vehicles (AAVs including quadcopters and micro air vehicles, MAVs) , swarm robots, humanoid robots, and autonomous household robots.
        <br><br>
        MIL's SubjuGator is the three time champion autonomous submarine of the RoboSub AUVSI/ONR underwater competition (2005-2007), and placed in the top 3 in eleven of the 17 years of the competition (including second place in 2012, 2013 and 2014). In 2013, MIL participated for the first time in the RoboBoat AUVSI/ONR water surface vechicle competition with our PropaGator robot boat; we won! In 2014, we earned second place in the RoboBoat competition. We also won the static division of the 2011 ION Robot Lawnmower competition with MIL's InstiGator robot lawnmower.
        <br><br>
        In the fall of 2005, MIL physically moved next door to CIMAR (The Center for Intelligent Machines and Robotics) in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department. We relocated our lab facilities and faculty offices adjacent to the CIMAR labs and offices in order to streamline our collaborations. With MIL (from Electrical and Computer Engineering Department) and CIMAR working together, the possibilities are incredible.</p>
